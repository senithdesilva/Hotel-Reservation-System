I will only use macros for commend buttons like &lsquo;Delete&rsquo;, &lsquo;Back&rsquo;, &lsquo;Add&rsquo; and more but mostly I&rsquo;ll be using VBA code. I think VBA is much more powerful and  flexible than Macros. It is one of the most easy-to-learn programming languages  out there. It does not require the complex programming techniques like in  C++/Java. VBA provides a user-friendly, forms-based interface to assign  variables and simplify code development. By learning the basic concepts of VBA  code, I have managed to write my own code. I have had enough practice in  writing VBA code and I feel more comfortable using VBA than Macro. But don&rsquo;t get  me wrong, Macros are considered to be easier to learn and in most cases it's  probably faster to create a macro than it is to write VBA code. Â <br />
    </h1>
    <h1>Why I&rsquo;m going to use VBA code for most procedures is because  VBA code allows me to present the user with professional forms-based layouts,  Process data in the background and perform conditional looping.</h1></th>
