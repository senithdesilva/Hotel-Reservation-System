    <th width="1204" height="599" scope="row"><h1>The first prototype was carried out right after the Initial  Design. The purpose of this prototype was to check if my designs were right at  the standards and suitable for the user. I asked Mr. David the Hotel manager of  the organisation to see the designs and if there are any changes to be made. I  thought it was best to ask Mr. David, because he has been working in the ICT  industry before joining the hotel Stream.<br />
      </h1>
      <h1>The Hotel manager&rsquo;s thoughts on the designs</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h1>Mr. David said that he loves the layout of the  system and wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing about it but he asked me if I can add the  Current Date and Time in the top of the Main Menu Form. So that the user can have  a better timing with his/her work. So I agreed with him and decided to add the  Current Date and Time in the top of the Main Menu Form. </h1>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h1>While going through the form Diagrams he mentioned  that in the Guest Navigation form whether  it is Necessary to add a Search Guest Button,  because all the Guest Details can be viewed in the subform. I replied Mr. David  saying &ldquo;yes, the user can view all the Guest Details in the subform but when  the subform is piling up with 100 of Guest Details, it will be hard for the  user to find a particular Guest Details. So that is why I added a search button&rdquo;.  Mr. David agreed with my statement. </h1>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h1>He mentioned that in the Report Form the appearance  is not good. He said adding something like a note before the button would be  okay. I agreed with him, it doesn&rsquo;t look very good. So we came up with the text  &ldquo;To View a Report choose one from the following categories&rdquo;.
        </h1>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h1>He also mentioned that when a certain detail is  been added to the database will the subforms show the details right after  update. For example: if a Guest Detail is been saved to the database will the  subform show that detail immediately. I considered his statement and thought  for a second, then I remembered I had the same problem in another project that  the subforms wouldn&rsquo;t update immediately. I knew what exactly needed to be done  here, I told Mr. David if I add a refresh button to the forms it will solve the  problem. So after the detail is been saved the user can click the refresh  button and view the latest update. He replied back saying if it solves this  problem then go ahead and add the refresh button.</h1>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h1>He mentioned that the form designs are very good.</h1>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h1>He stated that the reports will come in hand for  the organisations growth.</h1>
