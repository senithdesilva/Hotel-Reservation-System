      <h1>It was year 2000 when the Hotel Lagoon Dining was   established, which is located in Sri Lanka. The Hotel Lagoon Dining Offers the  guest a friendly and a relaxing environment. The hotel is equipped with a  sanitized pool, a bar and family rooms to relax and enjoy. Mr. Rahul Anthonis  the Organiser at Hotel Lagoon Dining has been keeping this organisation running for a long period of time. But with the current system the organisation  seems to be collapsing every minute and it&rsquo;s just a matter of time when the  business will run out. It&rsquo;s a difficult task for the organiser to make this  organisation run smoothly and more profitable.<br />
        I have accepted this project to tackle the problems and  upgrade the current system to a newer hotel reservation system. <br />

      <h1><u>The Current Manual System</u><br />
    </h1>
    <h1>Nowadays in this generation work is required to be done in  an easy and a quicker way. But in Hotel Lagoon Dining work doesn&rsquo;t run easy or  an in quicker way. The Hotel Lagoon Dining still uses the manual procedure of making  booking and creating reports such as Guest Summary, monthly income, Total cost  and etc. The current system uses paper base materials to fill in all the guest  details and booking details. The current system is way too disorganized and the guests  information are been hand written in papers and kept in filing cabinets. To  find a guest detail it will take a huge amount of time for the employees to  search. Even if the employees go on searching, they won&rsquo;t be able to collect  the details in time. Sometimes paperwork sheets can get lost, this could happen  easily in a current system. When guest details are been hand written by the employee&rsquo;s  mistakes can easily happen throughout the process and sometimes it can be hard  for someone to read the sheets. In the current system over booking rooms can  easily happen without any knowledge. If the filing cabinets are not secured, guest&rsquo;s  information can be stolen or accessed by unauthorized personnel&rsquo;s. This can be  a disadvantage for the organisation. In the current system security wise is not  guarantee to all information. </h1></th>
